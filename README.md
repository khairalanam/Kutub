## Summary

Kutub is not just a bookstore. It’s a one-of-a-kind bookstore. It’s the bookstore of the Web 3.0. When you browse through the huge collection of 100,000+ books we have, the books that you have paid for are secured by blockchain via Solana Pay

## Problem

* The idea of going through each platform, finding the contest for you, and repeating it for other platforms in case you couldn't find one, is a very tedious task.
* Students waste a lot of time just going through contests' information rather than actual preparations for the contests.

## Solution

* With CPFolio, one can easily find information on all the coding contests from different platforms in one place, making it an easy task.
* With CPFolio, students save a lot of time going through the information. Essential information like the host, start time, end time, etc keep students informed on the contests.
