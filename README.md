## Summary

Kutub is not just a bookstore. It’s a one-of-a-kind bookstore. It’s the bookstore of the Web 3.0. When you browse through the huge collection of 100,000+ books we have, the books that you have paid for are secured by blockchain via Solana Pay and hosted on IPFS.

## Problem

* The lack of application of blockchain in important day to day lives is a good example of wasted potential. Blockchain technology has the potential to develop efficient systems that are much superior to traditional systems.
* The current payment system is slow and costly. With the use of Solana Pay, it kills two birds with one stone; in terms of having high speed and low cost.
* With ever increasing number of scams, the traditional system of payments for an eCommerce website is not going to go for long.

## Solution

* With Kutub, we are using cryptocurrency as the main payment system via Solana Pay (SOL Tokens). Customers can buy a book and pay using their favourite cryptocurrency, and not to mention they can use NFTs as a medium of exchange too!
* Since Kutub is stored on IPFS and uses Solana Pay as its payment system, every transaction that has ever occurred inside Kutub are recorded in the blockchain. This can help people and investigators trace back the lost money due to scams.
* Kutub is just one of the many applications I would like to show with blockchain technology used in a business, personal or corporate.
